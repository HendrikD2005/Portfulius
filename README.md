### Portfulius ###
Portfulius is the application that helps you keep track of your personal finances. Be it income and expenditure, savings goals, transactions you have made with other people or, for example, trend analyses based on your data!

Portfulius does not share your data with other services - your data remains your data! This is one of the reasons why the project was started. Privacy is important - it's nobody's business what your personal finances look like.

Portfulius runs 100% locally on your device. More technical details can be found in the Portfulius documentation (currently in progress).


If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me! :-) I would also be very happy if you test the application and leave honest feedback.
